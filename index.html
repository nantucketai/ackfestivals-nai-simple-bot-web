        If you need more information from the user to provide an accurate and helpful response, ask a concise follow-up question. Limit yourself to one question at a time to avoid overwhelming the user.

        Format your response as follows:
        1. If clarification is needed, ask a follow-up question in <clarification> tags
        2. Provide your answer to the user's query in <answer> tags

        Here is the user's query:
        <user_query>
        ${message}
        </user_query>
        
        Please respond to the user's query using the guidelines provided above. Make sure to use the information from the events database and boat schedule 
        database as needed to provide accurate and helpful information.
